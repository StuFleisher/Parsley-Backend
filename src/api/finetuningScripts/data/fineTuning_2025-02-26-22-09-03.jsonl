Add the whole head of cabbage and boil for 5 minutes.  Remove to a colander to drain and cool.  Once cooled, cut 1/2 inch off the stem end of the cabbage.

It makes all the difference when it comes to rolling these guys.  It is almost impossible to roll a cabbage leaf that has not been boiled since it is stiff as a board.\nThe ground meat does not need to be precooked.\nAfter boiling the cabbage, use a sharp knife to slice the root end off about 1/2 – 3/4 inch up. This will make it easier to remove the leaves.\nAre you always in a hurry and need to cut a few corners?

With nine probably-in-your-pantry ingredients and no special equipment, you can get it into the oven in about 10 minutes. It’s the recipe I pull out when I’m having people over at the last minute or heading to a gathering and don’t have time to make something elaborate. Despite the easy technique, this cake over-delivers on flavor and presentation. The flourless formula makes it naturally gluten-free, while the inclusion of orange zest massaged into the sugar (and a bit of juice in the batter as well) puts a twist on the classic chocolate cake that food director Chris Morocco, a noted chocolate-orange hater, called “beguiling.” With a lofty cloud of whipped cream on top, dotted with shaved chocolate and thinly sliced orange zest, it’s a treat everyone can get behind. For the cleanest slices, pull your knife back up through your cut rather than dragging it out the back of each slice, which can crack the outer edges of the cake, and wipe down the knife between cuts.\n\nThis recipe is from our Dinner With Friends series. Get the full menu here: How to Throw a Dinner Party With Just $60\n\nRecipe information\nTotal Time\t40 minutes (plus cooling)\nYield\t10 servings\nIngredients\n10 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus more for pan\n1 large orange\n1 cup (200 g) sugar\n8 oz. bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped, plus more shaved for serving\n½ cup plus 1 Tbsp. (45 g) unsweetened cocoa powder\n1 tsp. baking powder\n¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt\n3 large eggs\n1 cup heavy cream\nSpecial Equipment\nA 9\"-diameter springform pan\nPreparation\nStep 1\nPlace a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350°. Butter bottom and sides of pan with unsalted butter. Remove a wide strip of orange zest from 1 large orange with a peeler and set aside. Finely grate remaining zest from orange into a large bowl; add 1 cup (200 g) sugar. Using your fingers, massage zest into sugar until mixture is homogenous and fragrant, about 1 minute. Set orange sugar aside.\n\nStep 2\nCut orange in half and squeeze 2 Tbsp. juice into a medium saucepan. Add 8 oz. bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped, and 10 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula and scraping down sides as needed, until melted and combined, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in ½ cup plus 1 Tbsp. (45 g) unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tsp. baking powder, and ¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Let chocolate mixture cool slightly.\n\nStep 3\nAdd 3 large eggs to reserved orange sugar and whisk to combine (you can use the same whisk without cleaning as it’s all going to the same place). Scrape in chocolate mixture and whisk to combine. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake cake until risen and top is set, 28–30 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan. Remove sides of pan.\n\nStep 4\nJust before serving, whisk 1 cup heavy cream in a medium bowl to form soft peaks; mound on top of cake, creating decorative swooshes with spoon. Using a sharp knife, very thinly slice reserved orange zest strip. Scatter orange zest and shaved bittersweet or semisweet chocolate over cake.\n\nDo Ahead: Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Tightly wrap cooled cake and chill. Bring to room temperature before topping with whipped cream, orange zest, and shaved chocolate.\n\n\nSave\n\nTags\nCake\nDessert\nEasy\nBaking\nQuick\nMake Ahead\nGluten Free\nNut Free\nChocolate\nOrange\nCitrus\nFruit"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"name\":\"Fudgy Chocolate Orange Cake\",\"owner\":\"\",\"description\":\"A simple, fudgy chocolate cake with a twist of orange zest, naturally gluten-free and perfect for last-minute gatherings.\",\"sourceName\":\"Unknown\",\"steps\":[{\"stepNumber\":1,\"instructions\":\"Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350°F.
